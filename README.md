# odin-restaurant-page
This is the restaurant page from TOP(the odin project) Full Stack JavaScript course.

This project is about building a restaurant page using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

The website will consist of a main html index page, a css page and javascript page.

By the end of the project, I will have demonstrated skills in setting up a website using my knowledge around JavaScript, DOM and Webpack.

Self-reflection and conclusion: this project was an opportunity to generate the entire content of a website using JavaScript alone and Webpack for multiple files and packages. the website was made with multiple import and export of javascript files.
